# EDA: Exploratory data analysis

The field of EDA has changed, thanks to advances in computational
and visualization technology.  Classical EDA addressed

- Assessing distributional shape

- Comparing batches of numbers: Boxplots and beyond

- Transformations; handling "outliers"

More recently, we can consider exploratory data activities that use

- interactive tables

- interactive graphics

- purpose-built graphical user interfaces

We will explore all of these concerns.  Our principles include

- always be prepared to "look at the data"

- every facet of your data should be accessible to exploration and summarization
